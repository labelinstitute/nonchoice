In this repository you will find: 

1. [Software](https://github.com/labelinstitute/nonchoice/tree/main/time_perception/Software/Software). Multistage is developed at SSEL at Caltech. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jp9XA6YVJm3eW9_c4rYbBQtlSfmJg9XO/view) are short instructions to run it. You first need to set up a network with your computers. *LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.*
