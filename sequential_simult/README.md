# The Path to Equilibrium in Sequential and Simultaneous Games: a Mouse tracking Study

In this repository you will find: 

1. [Software](https://github.com/labelinstitute/nonchoice/tree/main/sequential_simult/Software). Multistage is developed at SSEL at Caltech. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jp9XA6YVJm3eW9_c4rYbBQtlSfmJg9XO/view) are short instructions to run it. You first need to set up a network with your computers. *LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.*

2. Instructions. In Appendix A in the paper. 

3. [Data](https://github.com/labelinstitute/nonchoice/tree/main/sequential_simult/Data).
